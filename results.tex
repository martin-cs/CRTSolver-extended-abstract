\section{Results}

\mbsays{Please help fill in the gaps and finish the text.  There doesn't need to be much test.}

We have implemented the algorithm in Section \ref{section:algorithm}
in a tool called \texttt{CRTSolver} which is available at
\url{https://whatever} under LICENSE-GOES-HERE.
%
It uses two instances of cvc5, one to solve the modulo sub-problems
and a second to check the candidate results.  The following options
are available \mbsays{Describe the options that will be compared here,
such as BV or Integer for the modulo sub-problems.}

We\mbsays{I tend to write in the ``active plural'', as in ``We have
  done this''.  Not everyone likes this.  Some people prefer to write
  in a passive tense ``\dots has been done''.  Pick whichever one you
  like and use it.} have created a set of benchmarks that \mbsays{describe the
  benchmarks, what are they proving, what are the parameters, etc.
  This should be enough that the columns in the result table make sense.}

In Table \ref{table:results} we give a comparison with \mbsays{Say
  which solver and cite the relevant paper -- see their websites for
  which one}.
\mbsays{Describe the experimental set up : what hardware/processor, what operating system, what solver versions,  what time and memory limits.}
\mbsays{ If a solver times out
put T/O in the time, if it is out of memory put M/O, if it returns
UNKNOWN then put U.  You need to say here in the paper this is what
they mean.}
These results are also shown in a cactus plot in Figure \ref{figure:cactus-plot}.

  \begin{tabular}{ccccccccc}
    \toprule
    Variables & Equations & Degree & SAT & Iterations & CRT Time w/ Integer & CRT Time w/ BV & cvc5 & z3 \\

\mbsays{Fill in the table.  Either use a program to generate it or

These result suggest that \mbsays{Write a paragraph or so about things
we can conclude.  For example, CRTSolver with bit-vectors is way
faster than with integer, they are both much faster than the other
solvers, there is a difference between SAT and UNSAT, etc. etc.}
