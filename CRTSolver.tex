\begin{abstract}
 The SMT-LIB theory of integers allows for non-linear terms and is thus
 undecideable in the general case.
 %
 This is a practical problem but also discourages work on
 the decideable and easy fragments of the theory.
 %
 In this extended abstract we present a simple semi-decision procedure
 for sets of polynomial integer equations that shows significant promise
 in preliminary experiments with synthetic benchmarks.
 %
 We hope that this will illuminate the considerable improvements that
 are possible with well known techniques from the Diophantine equation and
 number theory literature.
