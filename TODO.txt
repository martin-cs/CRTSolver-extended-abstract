Things We Need to Do
====================

* Results table
  remove the actual equation
  SAT column should say SAT or UNSAT
  time in seconds, more than 1 sec -> use 3 decimal places, if it is less than 1s write in scientific notation with 3 sig. fig.
  I/O should have time with it

* Cactus plot
  for each solver, take just the runs which give SAT or UNSAT, sort them by asceding run-time and plot number of problems solved

* Pick a license

* Tag the version of the code use to make the results.

* Find out why the CRTSolver is timing out on some of the benchmarks -- is it the modulo computation or the candidates?

* Try out changing the candidate checking to use disjunctions (see e-mail)

* Tests for multiple equations
  number of equations 1 to 5
  degrees 2 to 6
  variables 1 to 6

* Verify these examples

* Try changing the modulo computation to use multi-precision / big integers so that it doesn't overflow.
