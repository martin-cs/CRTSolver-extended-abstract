Things We Need to Do
====================

* Results table - DONE
  remove the actual equation
  SAT column should say SAT or UNSAT
  time in seconds, more than 1 sec -> use 3 decimal places, if it is less than 1s write in 
    scientific notation with 3 sig. fig.
  I/O should have time with it

* Cactus plot - DONE
  for each solver, take just the runs which give SAT or UNSAT, sort them by asceding run-time 
    and plot number of problems solved

* Pick a license - DONE

* Tag the version of the code use to make the results. - DONE

* Find out why the CRTSolver is timing out on some of the benchmarks -- is it the modulo computation or the candidates? -- Neither, with a slightly increased time out limit there is no issue.

* Put in a guard and stop just before the integer overflow and return unknown.  In the results table mark this "U (7.10*10^{-2})"

* Tests for multiple equations
  number of equations 1 to 5
  degrees 2 to 6
  variables 1 to 6

* Try out changing the candidate checking to use disjunctions (see e-mail)

* Verify these examples

* Try changing the modulo computation to use multi-precision / big integers so that it doesn't overflow.


~~~~~

Final bits

* Fix the issue with bit widths.

* Run a final set of results on the original 30, as many of the others as you can, ideally with the multiple equation benchmarks.

* Get the tables and cactus plots into the paper.

* Any proof reading and other text tweaks done.
