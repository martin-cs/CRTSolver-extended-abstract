\section{Algorithm}
\label{section:algorithm}

This section gives a semi-decision procedure for polynomial integer
equations.
%
It is based on the following two elementary observations:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{If a set of equations is satisfiable over the integers then it
  will be satisfiable modulo any number.  We use the converse -- if a
  set of equations is unsatisfiable over a specific modulus then it
  must be unsatifiable over the integers.}
\item{If a set of equations is solvable modulo $p$ and $q$ with $p$ and
  $q$ being coprime then they will be solvable modulo $p*q$.  This is a
  consequence of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.}
\end{enumerate}
%
These are used to create an abstraction-refinement loop using a pair
of solvers.  One computes the solutions modulo a product of primes
(giving an over-approximation of the true satisfying assignments) and
the other checks these candidates.
%
The algorithm consists of a loop of four phases, illustrated in Figure
\ref{figure:algorithm}

\begin{description}
  \item[Pick Prime]{The next prime number $p$ from the list of
  ascending primes is picked. On the first iteration, $p = 2$}
  \item[Solve Modulo Subproblems]{The original equation is reduced modulo 
  $p$ by applying mod $p$ to each term individually}
  \item[Extract Candidates]{If satisfiable, candidate values for each variable 
  in the subproblem are extracted from the solver}
  \item[Check Candidates]{The Chinese Remainder Thoerem is used to compute
  several new candidates for each variable based on the previously extracted 
  candidates. Each possible combination of candidate values is checked for 
  satisfiability against the original problem}
\end{description}

\mbsays{Create a flow-chart of the phases.  I can do this if you don't
feel like doing it}
\mmsays{I will prioritise the other tasks. In the meantime, I will add
a hand-drawn flowchart to the repo}


\mbsays{If have a worked example and want to include it, here would be
  good.}

We should probably say something about correctness, complexity or completeness.
That might be ``We don't know''. \mbsays{Think about this.}

I think there are theorems which says something like:
\begin{itemize}
\item{This is a semi-decision procedure (if it terminates then it is correct)}
\item{If all of the variables are bounded so they have a finite range
  then the algorithm will terminate}
\end{itemize}
but I am unsure if we will have time to prove these.
