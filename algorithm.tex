This section gives a semi-decision procedure for polynomial integer
equations.
%
It is based on the following two elementary observations:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{If a set of equations is satisfiable over the integers then it
  will be satisfiable modulo any number.  We use the contraposition -- if a
  set of equations is unsatisfiable over a specific modulus then it
  must be unsatifiable over the integers.}
\item{If a set of equations is solvable modulo $p$ and $q$ with $p$ and
  $q$ being coprime then they will be solvable modulo $p*q$.  This is a
  consequence of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.}
\end{enumerate}
%
These are used to create an abstraction-refinement style loop using a pair
of solvers.  One computes the solutions modulo a product of primes
(giving an over-approximation of the true satisfying assignments) and
the other checks these candidates.
%
The algorithm consists of a loop of four phases, illustrated in Figure
\ref{figure:algorithm}:

\begin{description}
\item[Select]{A new modulo $m_i$, co-prime with all previous modulos is chosen.
We currently use an ascending list of primes, starting from $m_0 = 2$.}

\item[Solve]{A copy of the set of equations computed $mod m_i$ is added
  to the modulo solver.  Then the modulo solver is checked for
  satisfiability.  If it is unsatisfiable then the equations are unsolvable
  modulo in at least one of $m_i$'s and thus the original problem is
  unsatisfiable.  If it is satisfiable then the model will give
  solutions for the equations modulo every $m_i$ used so far.}

\item[Candidates]{The Chinese Remainder Theorem is used to compute
  a solution modulo $\Pi m_i$.  These are used to build a number of
  candidates over $\mathbb{Z}$, each of which is the solution
  modulo $\Pi m_i$ plus $k \Pi m_i$.  Currently we produce candidates
  for  $k \in [-2,2]$.}

\item[Check]{The original equations are evaluated using the candidate
  solutions.  If this gives a satisfying assignment then the original
  system is satisfiable.  If all of the candidates fail to satisfy the
  original equations then a new modulus must be used.}
\end{description}


\mbsays{If have a worked example and want to include it, here would be
  good.}

%We should probably say something about correctness, complexity or completeness.
%That might be ``We don't know''. \mbsays{Think about this.}
%
%I think there are theorems which says something like:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{This is a semi-decision procedure (if it terminates then it is correct)}
%\item{If all of the variables are bounded so they have a finite range
%  then the algorithm will terminate}
%\end{itemize}
%but I am unsure if we will have time to prove these.

The algorithm above is a semi-decision procedure -- if it terminates
then it will give the correct result.
%
However the termination of the algorithm is less obvious than it might
appear.
%
There are equations which are satisfiable modulo any $m$ but are not
satisfiable over $\Z$.
For example:
%
\begin{equation*}
  w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1 = 0
\end{equation*}
%
\noindent clearly as no solutions over $\Z$ but by Lagrange's Four
Square Theorem there are solutions for any modulus $m$.
