It works (on the limited set of benchmarks we have tried).

It shows enough promise to be investigated further.
We want to try to implement it in an actual solver.

There are many open questions and possible future directions:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Are there better encodings for solving the modulo sub problems in the BV solver?}
\item{We select primes sequentially, is that the best thing to do or are there better strategies given the encoding, the constants in the problem, how previous candidates have failed, etc.}
\item{How many candidates should be checked, how should they be picked?}
\item{Can the failed candidates be used to improve the modulo sub problems?}
\item{Can this technique be extended to non-equalities ($\not=$), inequalities ($\leq$) and non-polynomial expressions?}
\end{itemize}
