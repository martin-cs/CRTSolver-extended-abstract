It works (on the limited set of benchmarks we have tried).
%
It shows enough promise to be investigated further.
We want to try to implement it in an actual solver.


There are many open questions and possible future directions for this work:

\begin{itemize}
%\item{We select primes sequentially, is that the best thing to do or are there better strategies given the encoding, the constants in the problem, how previous candidates have failed, etc.}
\item{Selection of modulo is an }

\item{Are there better encodings for solving the modulo sub problems in the BV solver?}
\item{How many candidates should be checked, how should they be picked?}
\item{Can the failed candidates be used to improve the modulo sub problems?}
\item{Can this technique be extended to non-equalities ($\not=$), inequalities ($\leq$) and non-polynomial expressions?}
\end{itemize}
